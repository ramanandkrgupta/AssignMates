 - in history page  move all the cancelled and completed orders to the bottom of the History  and write Previous orders  text in left side and  on current orders write Ongoing orders

 - in top header make the My orders in left side and make right side a button + make new order button there  so we can have more area for orders

 - and on scrolling make sure it not showing the bottom most history page because of the navigation menu so somehow make it like this i can see bottom most too okay
